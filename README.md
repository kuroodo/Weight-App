Since Github has decided that they will be forcing 2FA onto accounts and locking people out of them if they don't set it up, I have moved my repositories to GitLab.

Microsoft has ruined Github and what it stood for.

I highly recommend GitLab to other users, and the repository migration process is quick and straightforward.
